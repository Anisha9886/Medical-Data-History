Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Let me walk you through my Medical Data History project, where I worked with SQL to manage and analyze healthcare data. ðŸš‘

The project is all about tracking patient admissions, doctor assignments, and building a structured database to make sense of medical records. I set up relational tables, established foreign key relationships, and ran some cool queries to answer questions like:

ðŸ©º Which doctors handle the most patients?
ðŸ“Š How often do patients return for follow-ups?
ðŸ“‚ What are the most common admission reasons?

It was exciting to see how SQL can make healthcare data more organized and useful. This project really helped me sharpen my database skills and showed how powerful SQL is in managing real-world data! ðŸ’»
