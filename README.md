# Medical-Data-History
The Medical Data History project is all about using SQL to make sense of healthcare data! I built relational tables to track patient admissions and doctor assignments, set up foreign keys, and ran queries to uncover patient visit trends and doctor performance. It was exciting to see how SQL turns real-world medical data into actionable insights!
